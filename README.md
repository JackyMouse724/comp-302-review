# COMP 302 review problems

This is a set of review problems for COMP 302 at McGill University.
I made it by looking at example problems done in class and in many cases
generalizing the example problems, and thinking of variant problems.

**DO THESE PROBLEMS ON PAPER.**
It's the most effective way to study for the exam, as the exam is on paper.

If there is an issue with a problem, please open an issue on this repo and I
will resolve it.

There is also a file `review-problems-sol.ml` in which I encourage you to type
up your solution for testing in LearnOCaml, if your solution is not already
present. Please send a pull request to this repo with your solution if it isn't
already there and I will be happy to include it.
